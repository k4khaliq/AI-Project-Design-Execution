4.3 Manager Peer Learning Circles
Managers are encouraged to participate in peer learning circles—small groups (6–10 managers) that meet monthly to:
- Discuss real challenges and share solutions
- Practice difficult conversations through role-play
- Learn from each other's experiences
- Build cross-functional relationships

Participation is voluntary but highly encouraged. HR facilitates circles and provides discussion guides.

5. WELLBEING-FOCUSED MANAGER TRAINING

Because managers are the first line of defense in burnout prevention, wellbeing-focused training is a priority.

5.1 Recognizing Early Warning Signs
Managers learn to identify:
- Behavioral changes (withdrawal, irritability, decline in communication)
- Performance patterns (missed deadlines, quality drops, increased errors)
- Work-life indicators (excessive hours, never taking leave, working while sick)
- Physical and emotional signals (visible fatigue, expressed overwhelm, health complaints)

Training includes case studies, video scenarios, and self-assessment tools.

5.2 Conducting Wellbeing Check-Ins
Managers practice:
- Opening conversations with empathy and non-judgment
- Asking open-ended questions about workload and capacity
- Active listening without offering unsolicited advice or "fixing"
- Discussing available resources (EAP, flexible work, workload adjustments, leave)
- Documenting conversations appropriately while respecting privacy

Role-play exercises allow managers to practice and receive feedback in a safe environment.

5.3 Using AI-Powered Wellbeing Tools
Where available, managers are trained on:
- Interpreting burnout risk scores and analytics dashboards
- Using AI-generated insights to inform (not replace) human judgment
- Understanding limitations and potential biases in predictive models
- Combining data insights with direct observation and conversation
- Protecting employee privacy when using wellbeing data

Training emphasizes that AI tools augment managerial judgment but do not replace the need for empathetic, individualized support.

6. MANAGER COACHING AND SUPPORT

6.1 Manager Coaching Program
Managers experiencing challenges may access:
- 1:1 coaching with internal HR coaches or external executive coaches
- Topic-specific support (e.g., managing underperformance, team conflict, personal stress)
- Confidential space to explore leadership style, blind spots, and growth areas

Coaching is voluntary and confidential. Participation does not indicate poor performance.

6.2 Manager Hotline and Office Hours
HR offers:
- Manager Hotline (email or phone) for quick questions or guidance on specific situations
- Monthly "Manager Office Hours" where managers can drop in for advice without formal appointments

These resources provide real-time support when managers face urgent or complex people issues.

7. MEASURING MANAGER EFFECTIVENESS

7.1 Manager Effectiveness Metrics
HR tracks:
- Completion rates for mandatory training
- Employee engagement scores by manager
- Retention rates and voluntary turnover by team
- Performance management activity (1:1 frequency, goal setting, feedback timeliness)
- Wellbeing indicators (team burnout risk, stress levels, use of support resources)

7.2 Manager Performance Reviews
Manager performance reviews include assessment of:
- People management skills (feedback, coaching, development)
- Team engagement and wellbeing outcomes
- Adherence to company policies and values
- Leadership behaviors and role modeling

Managers who consistently underperform on people management dimensions receive targeted coaching, additional training, or may be transitioned out of management roles.

7.3 360-Degree Feedback
Managers receive 360-degree feedback at least every 18–24 months, including input from:
- Direct reports (aggregated and anonymized for teams of 5+)
- Peers and cross-functional partners
- Their own manager

Feedback focuses on leadership behaviors, communication effectiveness, support for development, and team wellbeing.

8. LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT FOR SENIOR MANAGERS

8.1 Senior Leadership Programs
Directors, VPs, and executives participate in:
- Strategic leadership development programs (external or custom-designed)
- Executive coaching engagements (typically 6–12 months)
- Leadership offsites and retreats focused on organizational challenges
- Mentoring and sponsorship training to support emerging leaders

8.2 Succession Planning and Talent Reviews
Senior leaders participate in:
- Annual talent reviews identifying high-potential employees
- Succession planning for critical roles
- Development planning for next-generation leaders

This ensures continuity and builds leadership bench strength.

9. MANAGER WELLBEING AND SELF-CARE

Managers face unique pressures, including responsibility for others' wellbeing, competing demands, and organizational expectations.

The company supports manager wellbeing through:
- Access to all employee wellbeing programs (EAP, flexible work, mental health days)
- Manager-specific support groups or peer circles
- Training on stress management and resilience for leaders
- Recognition that managers cannot support others if they are burned out themselves

Managers are encouraged to:
- Model healthy work habits (boundaries, taking leave, asking for help)
- Seek support when feeling overwhelmed
- Discuss workload and capacity with their own manager

9.1 Manager Burnout Prevention
Managers showing signs of burnout receive:
- Confidential conversation with HR or senior leadership
- Assessment of workload, span of control, and support needs
- Adjustments to responsibilities or expectations where feasible
- Access to coaching or external support

Manager burnout is taken seriously because it directly impacts team wellbeing and performance.

10. EXTERNAL LEARNING AND CONFERENCES

Managers may request funding for:
- Leadership conferences or summits
- Professional certifications (e.g., coaching certifications, HR credentials)
- Executive education programs at universities
- Industry-specific leadership events

Requests are evaluated based on:
- Relevance to role and development plan
- Budget availability
- Commitment to share learnings with the team or organization

Approval authority varies by cost; HR provides guidance on the process.

11. RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER POLICIES

This policy supports:
- Burnout Prevention Policy (manager role in early detection and intervention)
- Mental Health and Wellness Policy (manager training on supportive conversations)
- Performance Management Policy (manager skills in feedback and development)
- Recognition and Rewards Policy (manager responsibility for acknowledgment)

Effective managers are critical to the success of all people-related policies and programs.

12. REVIEW AND CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT

This policy is reviewed every two years or when organizational structure, leadership models, or business priorities change significantly.

HR collects feedback from managers through:
- Training evaluations and post-program surveys
- Manager focus groups
- Analysis of engagement and wellbeing data by team
- Exit interview insights on manager effectiveness

Insights inform program design, training content, and resource allocation.
