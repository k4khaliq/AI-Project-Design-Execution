PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEE DEVELOPMENT POLICY
Version: 3.2
Effective Date: January 2026
Department: Human Resources
Classification: Company-Wide Policy

1. PURPOSE AND SCOPE
This policy defines how the company manages performance, provides feedback, supports development, and integrates wellbeing into performance conversations. It applies to all employees and aims to foster growth, accountability, and sustainable high performance.

2. CORE PHILOSOPHY
- Performance management is continuous, not limited to annual reviews.
- Development and wellbeing are inseparable from performance.
- Feedback should be timely, specific, and constructive.
- Employees and managers share responsibility for growth and success.
- Career stagnation and lack of development increase burnout risk and must be actively prevented.

3. PERFORMANCE REVIEW CYCLE

3.1 Annual Performance Review
All employees receive a formal performance review at least once per year, typically aligned with the fiscal year.

The review includes:
- Assessment of goal achievement and key results
- Evaluation against role competencies and company values
- Discussion of strengths and development areas
- Rating or classification where applicable (e.g., Exceeds, Meets, Needs Improvement)
- Development plan for the coming period

Reviews are documented in the HR system and inform compensation, promotion, and succession planning decisions.

3.2 Mid-Year Check-In
A structured mid-year conversation occurs approximately six months after the annual review.

Topics include:
- Progress on annual goals and development plan
- Adjustment of goals if business priorities have shifted
- Early identification of performance concerns or support needs
- Workload and wellbeing discussion

The mid-year check-in is documented but typically does not result in a formal rating.

3.3 Ongoing Feedback (Continuous Performance Management)
Managers provide regular feedback outside formal reviews, including:
- Weekly or bi-weekly 1:1 meetings
- Real-time coaching after key events or projects
- Recognition of strong performance
- Early course correction when issues emerge

Employees are encouraged to request feedback proactively and share their own perspectives on workload, priorities, and development needs.

4. GOAL SETTING AND EXPECTATIONS

4.1 SMART Goals
Goals should be:
- Specific: Clearly defined with measurable outcomes
- Measurable: Progress can be tracked with data or milestones
- Achievable: Realistic given resources, time, and constraints
- Relevant: Aligned with team and company priorities
- Time-Bound: Have clear deadlines or completion dates

4.2 Balancing Stretch and Sustainability
Goals should challenge employees to grow without creating unsustainable pressure.

Managers must:
- Consider current workload before adding new goals
- Revisit goals if circumstances change significantly
- Discuss trade-offs when priorities conflict
- Avoid setting goals that require chronic overwork to achieve

Unrealistic or conflicting goals are a known burnout risk factor and should be escalated to HR if they cannot be resolved.

5. DEVELOPMENT PLANNING

5.1 Individual Development Plans (IDPs)
All employees create an annual development plan covering:
- Skills or competencies to build in the next 12–18 months
- Specific development activities (training, projects, mentoring, stretch assignments)
- Career aspirations and potential paths
- Resources or support needed

IDPs are created collaboratively between employee and manager and reviewed at least twice per year.

5.2 Learning and Training Opportunities
The company supports development through:
- Internal training programs and workshops
- External courses, certifications, or conferences (subject to approval and budget)
- On-the-job stretch assignments or rotations
- Mentoring and coaching programs
- Access to learning platforms and resources

Employees should complete a minimum of 20 hours of learning or development activity per year. Managers track participation and discuss development progress in 1:1s.

5.3 Career Stagnation Prevention
Career stagnation—defined as lack of growth, learning, or advancement over extended periods—is a significant burnout risk.

To prevent stagnation:
- Employees with 3+ years in the same role without promotion or significant skill development should discuss career goals with their manager and HR.
- Managers must proactively identify employees at risk of stagnation and create development opportunities.
- Lateral moves, project rotations, or skill-building assignments are encouraged as alternatives to vertical promotion where appropriate.
- Lack of development opportunities should be flagged to leadership if it affects multiple team members (may indicate structural issues).

6. ADDRESSING PERFORMANCE CONCERNS

6.1 Early Intervention
When performance issues arise, managers must:
- Address concerns promptly, not wait for formal reviews
- Have a private, direct conversation focused on specific behaviors or outcomes
- Understand root causes (skill gaps, workload, personal circumstances, unclear expectations)
- Agree on a plan with clear actions, timelines, and support
- Document the conversation and follow up regularly

6.2 Performance Improvement Plans (PIPs)
If performance does not improve after informal coaching, a formal Performance Improvement Plan may be required.

PIPs include:
- Specific performance gaps with examples
- Clear success criteria and measurable objectives
- Timeline (typically 30, 60, or 90 days)
- Resources and support provided
- Consequences if improvement is not achieved

PIPs are managed jointly by the manager and HR to ensure fairness and consistency.

6.3 Wellbeing Considerations in Performance Management
Before initiating performance improvement processes, managers must:
- Consider whether wellbeing, burnout, or workload issues are contributing to performance decline
- Refer to Burnout Prevention Policy and Mental Health Policy if wellbeing concerns are present
- Distinguish between capability issues and unsustainable work conditions
- Involve HR to determine whether support interventions should precede or accompany performance action

It is inappropriate to penalize employees for performance decline caused by unreasonable workload or lack of support.

7. PERFORMANCE AND WELLBEING INTEGRATION

Performance and wellbeing are interdependent. High performance is not sustainable if it comes at the cost of employee health.

7.1 Wellbeing Check-Ins in Performance Conversations
Every 1:1 and performance review should include:
- Explicit discussion of workload and capacity
- Questions about stress, balance, and sustainability
- Identification of barriers or constraints affecting performance
- Offer of support resources (EAP, flexible work, workload adjustments)

Managers who consistently fail to address wellbeing in performance conversations may be coached or have this reflected in their own performance reviews.

7.2 Recognizing Healthy Performance
The company values sustainable performance and healthy work habits.

Behaviors to recognize and encourage:
- Delivering strong results within normal working hours
- Taking regular breaks and using vacation time
- Asking for help or flagging overload early
- Supporting teammates and contributing to a positive culture

Behaviors to discourage:
- Chronic overwork or "always on" patterns
- Sacrificing health or personal time to meet deadlines
- Competing on hours worked rather than outcomes
- Encouraging unhealthy work patterns in others

8. COMPENSATION AND PROMOTION DECISIONS

8.1 Link to Performance Reviews
Performance ratings inform but do not solely determine:
- Annual salary increases or merit adjustments
- Bonus payouts where applicable
- Promotion eligibility
- Participation in high-visibility projects or development programs

Compensation and promotion decisions also consider:
- Market factors and internal equity
- Role changes or increased responsibility
- Potential and readiness for next-level roles

8.2 Transparency and Communication
Employees receive clear communication about:
- How performance ratings translate to compensation decisions
- Promotion criteria and timelines
- When and how compensation decisions are made

If performance expectations are not met, employees should understand the impact on compensation and career progression early, not at decision time.

9. MANAGER RESPONSIBILITIES AND TRAINING

Managers must:
- Conduct timely, honest, and constructive performance conversations
- Provide ongoing feedback, not just annual reviews
- Support employee development through coaching, resources, and opportunities
- Integrate wellbeing discussions into all performance conversations
- Apply performance standards fairly and consistently across team members

All managers complete:
- Performance management training within 90 days of becoming a manager
- Annual refresher on feedback techniques and difficult conversations
- Wellbeing integration training aligned with Burnout Prevention Policy

Managers who consistently fail to meet performance management expectations may be removed from management roles.

10. EMPLOYEE RESPONSIBILITIES

Employees are expected to:
- Participate actively in goal setting and performance discussions
- Seek feedback and clarification when expectations are unclear
- Own their development by identifying learning needs and pursuing opportunities
- Raise concerns early if workload or resources are insufficient to meet expectations
- Provide honest input about wellbeing and capacity

11. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORDS

Performance-related documentation includes:
- Annual review summaries and ratings
- Mid-year check-in notes
- Development plans and progress updates
- Performance improvement plans where applicable
- Recognition and spot bonus records

Documents are stored securely in the HR system with access limited to the employee, manager, HR, and senior leadership where appropriate.

Mental health or wellbeing information disclosed during performance conversations is handled separately under the Mental Health and Wellness Policy and not included in performance records unless directly relevant to accommodations or support plans.

12. PERFORMANCE DATA AND ANALYTICS

HR may use aggregated performance data to:
- Identify trends in performance ratings, development activity, and promotion rates
- Assess fairness and consistency across teams and demographics
- Correlate performance patterns with engagement, wellbeing, or retention
- Inform organizational learning and leadership development programs

Individual performance data is confidential and used only for legitimate HR and management purposes.

13. RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER POLICIES

This policy works in conjunction with:
- Burnout Prevention Policy (workload management, recognition)
- Mental Health and Wellness Policy (wellbeing integration, accommodations)
- Recognition and Rewards Policy (acknowledgment as part of feedback culture)
- Learning and Development programs (skill building, career growth)
- Compensation and promotion guidelines (decision-making processes)

14. DISPUTES AND CONCERNS

Employees who believe performance management processes are unfair, biased, or not followed correctly may:
- Discuss concerns with their manager or skip-level manager
- Escalate to HR or their HR Business Partner
- Use the company's grievance or feedback channels

All concerns are reviewed confidentially, and retaliation for raising good-faith concerns is prohibited.

15. REVIEW AND CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT

This policy is reviewed every two years or when business practices, legal requirements, or organizational structure change materially.

HR collects feedback from employees and managers through surveys, focus groups, and exit interviews to continuously improve performance management practices.
