EMPLOYEE RECOGNITION AND REWARDS POLICY
Version: 2.3
Effective Date: January 2026
Department: Human Resources
Classification: Company-Wide Policy

1. PURPOSE AND PHILOSOPHY
Recognition is a critical driver of engagement, motivation, and burnout prevention. This policy establishes how the company acknowledges contributions, celebrates achievements, and reinforces desired behaviors at all levels. Frequent, meaningful recognition reduces burnout risk by building connection, purpose, and psychological safety.

2. CORE PRINCIPLES
- Recognition should be timely, specific, sincere, and proportional to impact.
- All employees deserve regular acknowledgment, not just top performers.
- Recognition is a shared responsibility across managers, peers, and leaders.
- Monetary and non-monetary recognition both matter; authenticity is essential.
- Recognition practices must be fair, transparent, and free from bias.

3. TYPES OF RECOGNITION

3.1 Informal Recognition (No Approval Required)
Managers and peers may provide:
- Verbal appreciation in team meetings or 1:1s
- Written thank-you notes or messages highlighting specific contributions
- Public recognition in team channels, newsletters, or company communications
- Personalized acknowledgment that connects work to team or company impact

Managers should provide informal recognition at least weekly to one or more team members.

3.2 Spot Bonuses
Spot bonuses recognize exceptional work beyond normal expectations.

Eligibility:
- All employees except senior executives
- Nominated by manager or peer with manager approval

Award Range:
- Standard: $100–$500 depending on impact and scope
- Exceptional: Up to $1,000 for major contributions with VP approval

Process:
- Manager submits nomination with specific description of impact
- Department head or HR approves within 2 business days
- Bonus paid in next payroll cycle
- Recipient receives personalized written acknowledgment
- Public announcement with employee consent

3.3 Quarterly or Annual Awards
The company may offer formal recognition programs such as:
- Quarterly MVP or Excellence Awards
- Annual Innovation or Leadership Awards
- Service Milestone Recognition (1, 3, 5, 10, 15+ years)

Details of specific award programs, selection criteria, and nomination processes are maintained by HR and communicated separately.

4. WHAT MAKES EFFECTIVE RECOGNITION

Effective recognition is:

Timely: Provided within days or weeks of the contribution, not deferred to annual reviews.

Specific: Names the behavior, action, or outcome being recognized with clear detail.
- Poor: "Great job on the project."
- Good: "Your detailed risk analysis in the client proposal last week identified three potential issues that would have delayed launch. The client specifically mentioned this as a reason they chose us."

Sincere: Genuine and authentic, not checkbox activity or forced praise.

Public or Private: Matched to individual preference; some prefer team recognition, others prefer private acknowledgment.

Proportional: Scaled to the significance of the contribution. A major achievement warrants more than a quick thank-you.

5. MANAGER RESPONSIBILITIES

All managers must:
- Recognize at least one team member publicly each week through team meetings, messages, or internal platforms.
- Provide immediate positive feedback when observing strong performance or helpful behavior.
- Submit spot bonus nominations or formal award nominations quarterly for deserving employees.
- Vary who receives recognition to avoid patterns of favoritism or overlooking quieter contributors.
- Ask employees about their recognition preferences (public vs. private, group vs. individual).
- Model appreciation by recognizing peers and leaders, not just direct reports.

Failure to provide regular recognition may be addressed in manager performance reviews or coaching.

6. PEER-TO-PEER RECOGNITION

The company encourages peer recognition through:
- Digital recognition platforms where employees can publicly thank or acknowledge colleagues
- Team celebrations for shared successes
- Informal thank-yous and shout-outs in meetings or communication channels

Peer recognition supplements, but does not replace, manager-led recognition.

7. RECOGNITION AND BURNOUT PREVENTION

Recognition is directly linked to burnout prevention. Employees who feel valued and appreciated are significantly less likely to experience burnout.

To support wellbeing:
- Recognize effort and growth, not just final outcomes or "heroic" overwork.
- Acknowledge contributions during difficult periods or when results fall short of expectations due to external factors.
- Celebrate sustainable performance and healthy work habits (e.g., respecting boundaries, taking leave).
- Avoid inadvertently rewarding unhealthy behaviors like chronic overwork or never taking time off.

Teams with consistently low recognition or unclear appreciation patterns are flagged as higher burnout risk and may be reviewed by HR.

8. RECOGNITION BUDGET AND RESOURCES

Each department receives an annual recognition budget based on:
- Headcount and expected spot bonus activity
- Planned formal award programs
- Team celebration and event funding

Managers must:
- Use recognition funds throughout the year, not just at year-end.
- Balance spot bonuses across team members over time.
- Coordinate with HR if budget is insufficient to recognize deserving employees.

9. FAIRNESS AND TRANSPARENCY

Recognition decisions must be:
- Based on observable contributions and impact, not subjective favoritism
- Distributed broadly across teams, roles, and levels
- Free from bias related to demographics, work style, or personal relationships
- Documented and reviewable if concerns arise

Employees who believe recognition practices are unfair or biased may raise concerns through their manager, HR, or the company's feedback or ethics channels.

10. MEASUREMENT AND CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT

HR tracks:
- Frequency of spot bonuses and formal awards by team and level
- Distribution of recognition across employee groups
- Employee survey scores on feeling valued and appreciated
- Correlation between recognition patterns and engagement or retention

Insights are used to identify gaps, improve manager training, and refine recognition programs.

11. RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER POLICIES

This policy supports:
- Burnout Prevention Policy (Section 7: Recognition and Engagement)
- Mental Health and Wellness Policy (prevention through positive work environment)
- Performance Management and Development Policy (recognition as part of feedback culture)

Recognition should be integrated into regular performance conversations, but does not replace formal performance reviews or compensation decisions.

12. REVIEW AND UPDATES

This policy is reviewed every two years or when recognition programs, tools, or company practices change materially.
